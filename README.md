# Personal Website (Homework)

#### Brief

The brief was to create a website with a landing page and at least three (3) additional pages on a topic of my choice.

#### Process

Deciding on using my personal hobbies to create the website I began with a hand-drawn wireframe, before moving to the computer and getting the basic layout written. From here it became easier to add the content and further pages into the pre-built page.

As I added further pages I decided to build it into more of a hobby *social media-esque* website with profile pages, a user list, and individual pages for each users hobby.

The technologies I used for this were:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap

#### Challenges

The carousel proved troublesome when adding images with different dimensions, particularly one that was portrait as opposed to landscape.
